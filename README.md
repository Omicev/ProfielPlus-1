# ProjectProfileApp

Project description:
For the study "Software Development" (year 1) at Windesheim College, 
we were asked to create a web portfolio application in the first period using HTML/CSS/JS/php/mySQL. 
The purpose of this application is that you can easily create a portfolio and edit it at any time. 
This means you have to spend less time on making an own portfolio and you can show in a creative way 
your portfolio to your future employer.

For whom?
For this project, the teachers play the role of the product owners. They determine the requirements/expectations 
that must be met for the final project and ultimately assess it with feedback afterwards or beforehand if any 
questions arise. By adhering to this, we will receive the assigned credits in return.

Most important features:
- Login and Register:
  Users must log in with their account or register if they do not have an account yet. Forgotten account name and password must also be checked.

- Profile management:
  Registered users can create, edit and delete their personal profiles. These profiles will contain information about school performance, work experience and hobbies.

- School performance:
  Users should be able to add, edit and delete school achievements, including information about schools, diplomas and grades.

- Work experience:
  Users should be able to enter, edit and delete their work experience, including details about employers, job titles and dates.

- Hobbies:
  Users can share their hobbies and interests, as well as images and descriptions of them.
